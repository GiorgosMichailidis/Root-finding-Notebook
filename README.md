# Root-finding-Notebook

This notebook uses three different iterative methods (Bisection method, False Position method, and Fixed Point method) to find the root of the equation: exp(x) + x - 2 = 0. You can adjust the equation at the beginning of the script.
The code computes:
1. The root with 6 significant digits.
2. The convergence of each method as a function of the number of iterations.
3. The approximate relative error.

This Python code was developed during the Computational Mathematics course, as part of the master's program in Computational Physics at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.
