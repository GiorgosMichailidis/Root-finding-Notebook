# Root-finding-Notebook

This notebook uses 3 different iterative methods (Bisection method, False position method, Fixed point method) to find the root of the equation: exp(x) + x - 2 = 0. You can adjust the equation in the begging of the script. The code computes  the root with 6 significant digits, the convergence of each method and the approximate relative error
